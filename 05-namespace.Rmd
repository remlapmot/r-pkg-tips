# NAMESPACE

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
  
- The `NAMESPACE` file is written by devtools when you run `devtools::document()` on your correctly formatted helpfiles
- You must specify to `@export` functions you want exported from your package!
- Remember to `@importFrom pkgname fn` the functions you have used from other packages in the roxygen code before your function
- Read <https://r-pkgs.org/namespace.html> many times!
- Remember what happens when we load a package - an environment of its objects are placed at the top of R's search path (figure from [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/environments.html#special-environments))  
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/environments.png")
```
- Every package has a package environment (the exported functions) and a namespace environment (both exported and internal functions)
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/namespaces-and-environments.png")
```
