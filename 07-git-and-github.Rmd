# Git and GitHub

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center")
```

- Use a visual Git editor, e.g. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Work in a new branch, especially if working with others
  - Then merge into main/master when you're sure your changes are what you want
- When coding, I recommend making your changes 
  - Then select relevant changed lines 
  - Use sensible commit messages, i.e., do not make one massive commit with commit message "Edits"!  
    ```{r}
    knitr::include_graphics("img/github-desktop-select-lines.png")
    ```  
  
- I prefer not to keep my git repositories in a folder which is also synchronized with OneDrive/Google Drive, e.g., when you render an R Markdown file the syncing of all the auxiliary files that are created can be very annoying
- When contributing to a new package, after forking on GitHub, then cloning to your local machine, and opening in RStudio/setting working directory to top level of package run `devtools::install_dev_deps()` to install all packages under Depends, Imports, and Suggests in its `DESCRIPTION` file
- Your repo can contain much more than just your R package
  - It will often additionally contain the static website for the package (made with pkgdown) which can be hosted for free using GitHub Pages/Netlify
  - Remember to exclude the files/folders not the package by adding them to the `.Rbuildignore` file
- Some people don't like others distributing packages through a GitHub repo, because `install_github()` looks for a change in the hash of the latest commit - but that may have been in a file not included in the source package
